# pfUI_BagshuiTT

A Vanilla WoW 1.12.1 plugin for those using pfUI with Bagshui bags.

pfUI's "Dodge" tooltip anchoring option stops working as soon as pfUI's own bags aren't being used.
This addon fixes that and makes pfUI's "Dodge" tooltip behavior work with Bagshui.

`/btt` and `/btt offset X Y` are the only available commands, for making adjustments to align better with Bagshui's bag frame.

Preview of all the addon does:
